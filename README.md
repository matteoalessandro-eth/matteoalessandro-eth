### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matteo, an atypical lawyer who specialises in DLT, and anything related to it. 

Looking to revolutionise the legal system with tech. I try (key word) to implement my ideas for a techno-legal system in code. My Github will be used for these concepts - any suggestions are welcome!

You can find more information about me on www.matteoalessandro.com!

This is not a phase. This is phase one.
